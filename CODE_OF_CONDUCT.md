# Code of Conduct

When interacting with this project, refrain from any harassing or stalking behavior towards other people and any derogatory statements. Interacting with the project includes creating issues, commenting on issues and creating and commenting on pull requests. Derogatory statements include *racism*, *xenophobia*, *sexism*, *ableism*, *homophobia*, *transphobia*, *specieism* and *adult supremacy*. Anything that could be considered "punching down" or kicking someone while they're down. Attack an idea you don't like, not the person behind it. Don't make people who did nothing evil feel uncomfortable. Be understanding of people whose first language isn't English. Non-English communication is allowed, but please summarize the exchange afterward in English. Be appreciative of people putting their time into fixing your issue for free. **No one is above these rules, not even the maintainer(s)**.
