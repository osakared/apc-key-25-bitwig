APC Key 25 Control Script for Bitwig
====================================

Introduction
------------

This is an attempt at getting
[APC Key 25](http://www.akaipro.com/product/apc-key-25) working with [Bitwig](http://www.bitwig.com).
The goal is to get it doing everything the official script does, plus more. Turn this affordable
piece of gear into a powerhouse with Bitwig and this script!

### Difference With Official Ableton Script:

* Shift + Sustain toggles velocity sensitivity on and off.
* Shift + clip button deletes a clip when in rec/arm mode.
* Shift + "Stop All Clips" returns to arrangement.
* Shift + Play/Pause does tap tempo.
* Shift + Record cycles through remote pages.
* In mute mode, the light indicates that the track _is_ muted.

### Nice to Haves:

* Ability to remap Shift + [Sustain, Play/Pause, Rec] since there are more features we could add than just the three and different people have different workflows
* Marquee/image mode (like Bitwig logo or APC on startup)
* Ability to use clip launchers as a keyboard (with selectable modes)

Installation
------------
